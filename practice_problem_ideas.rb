#deliberate practice
# an array of hashes, collect all movie titles that are overdue
# an array of strings, use #map to return an array of reversed strings
# given a random string from an array, loop through up to 10 ties for user to guess string using gets.chomp
# model two people(employee, boss), exchanging money using classes(paycheck, expenses, etc)

---

# use classes to calculate tips received by server
# an array of name hashes, collect all that have names starting with a vowel
# guessing game, let a user pick an option 1-3 if, if they match the random answer they get back winner// or game of chance that returns winner or loser after automatically generating
# random math problem, if user puts correct answer put correct etc.
# an array of strings, use #map to return an array of reversed strings

# an array of strings, count which one has the most a's

## go back through the whirlwind excercises that you didn't finish:
# Hashes
# Create a banking program that asks the user 5 times to enter a first name, last name, and email. This information should be stored as an array of hashes. 
# Each person should automatically be given an account number which is a randomized ten digit number.
# After the user is finished, the program should print out all the users, for example:
# FIRST NAME: Joan
# LAST NAME: Kelson
# EMAIL: jkelson@juno.com
# ACCT #: 2372041038
# and so on for all the users.
# Final Review
# Create a program that puts your class into groups! Have the program request the user to enter each student’s names.  Assume the classroom has an even number of students, so there are only groups of two. For example, you can have the program output groups like so:
#   Group: Hermione Seamus
#       Group: Lucius Cho
#       Group: Sirius Luna
#       Group: Severus Draco
# Refactor the program to take an odd or even number of students. If odd, one group should have three students. 
#   Group: Hermione Seamus
#       Group: Lucius Cho
#       Group: Sirius Luna
#       Group: Severus Draco Harry
# ****Bonus*****
# Continue with Exercise 3: Expand the program so a user gets all the account info by entering an account number i.e. prompt the user to enter an account number, and output the first_name, last_name, etc.
# Also continue with exercise 3: reject a user entering an account if the email address doesn’t have an “@” and doesn’t end in “.com” Prompt the user to try again if this happens.
